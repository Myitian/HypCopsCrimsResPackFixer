# HypCopsCrimsResPackFixer
A patcher to fix Hypixel Cops and Crime resource pack on high versions of Minecraft.

## Notice
This is a program, **NOT** a resource pack!

## Known Compatibility Problems
Since Sodium does not support vanilla resource pack shaders, paintings may lose transparency when Sodium is installed.

## Usage
1. Join Hypixel Cops and Crime lobby and wait for the resource pack to be downloaded;
2. Start the patch program;
3. Enter .minecraft folder path, or use the default value;
4. Enter output resource pack name, or use the default value;
5. When the program outputs "Done!" and exits, you can find a new resource pack in `.minecraft/resourcepacks` folder;
6. Enable the resource pack in game;
7. Now the font and paintings should now display correctly.

## Dependency
.NET 8
